# STAT 301 Project: Airbnb Price Analysis in Athens
This project was developed as part of STAT 301: Statistical Modelling for Data Science at UBC.
It explores the factors influencing Airbnb prices in Athens, Greece, through a complete data science workflow, from acquiring data online to presenting conclusions in a reproducible Jupyter Notebook report.

## Stage 1
In this stage, I completed the initial exploration of the Airbnb dataset for Athens.
I downloaded the data from the web, cleaned and wrangled it into a tidy format, and created a descriptive summary of all variables, including their names, types, and data sources.
I identified redundant or irrelevant variables in a short Pre-selection of Variables section.
Then, I formulated my scientific question regarding how different property and location features relate to Airbnb listing prices, and specified the response and explanatory variables.
Finally, I performed exploratory data analysis and visualization, creating an informative multi-variable plot to investigate potential relationships and patterns that will guide later modelling.
